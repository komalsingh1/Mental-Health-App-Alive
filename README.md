## Short description

### What's the problem?
The COVID-19  has not only shaken the entire human race but has also left us all pondering  about the things we always had but never cherished. In this pandemic, many have lost jobs, many are stuck at distant lands and many have started feeling the pangs of isolation. Hopelessness has never dawned upon our human race like this before, and we are caught unprepared.  Mental health that is the primary foundation of our existence is being so widely neglected that we need to rethink our needs as humans now.


### How can technology help?

A self assessment test carefully created in the beginning will lead you through questions that will help us calculate your stress level and then we may recommend some therapy based on that. For this we have a powerful recommendation system designed at the back end in which we hope to integrate machine learning in the near future.
A Bot that can talk like a Friend and recommend something to help fight Depression and stress.

### The idea

we offer an innovative stress management strategy that includes mental well being section (meditation/affirmations), physical heath section (expertise/workouts), time management tool, reading section, music section and
also a very chatty little robot 'Oliver with a twist' that we have trained by using the IBM Watson. Trust us.. our bot is a philosopher :)

## Project roadmap

![Roadmap](https://github.com/komalsingh1/Mental-Health-App-Alive/blob/master/MentalHealthApp.pptx)

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
insatll Node.js
install Angular CLI (version 9.1.7)
Install .NET
```
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


## Built with

* [IBM Watson Service]
* .NET 
* Angular 9
