## Short description

### What's the problem?
The COVID-19  has not only shaken the entire human race but has also left us all pondering  about the things we always had but never cherished. In this pandemic, many have lost jobs, many are stuck at distant lands and many have started feeling the pangs of isolation. Hopelessness has never dawned upon our human race like this before, and we are caught unprepared.  Mental health that is the primary foundation of our existence is being so widely neglected that we need to rethink our needs as humans now.


### How can technology help?

A self assessment test carefully created in the beginning will lead you through questions that will help us calculate your stress level and then we may recommend some therapy based on that. For this we have a powerful recommendation system designed at the back end in which we hope to integrate machine learning in the near future.
A Bot that can talk like a Friend and recommend something to help fight Depression and stress.

### The idea

we offer an innovative stress management strategy that includes mental well being section (meditation/affirmations), physical heath section (expertise/workouts), time management tool, reading section, music section and
also a very chatty little robot 'Oliver with a twist' that we have trained by using the IBM Watson. Trust us.. our bot is a philosopher :)

## Project roadmap

![Roadmap](roadmap.jpg)

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
dnf install wget
wget http://www.example.com/install.sh
bash install.sh
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, for example

```bash
export TOKEN="fffd0923aa667c617a62f5A_fake_token754a2ad06cc9903543f1e85"
export EMAIL="jane@example.com"
dnf install npm
node samplefile.js
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

And repeat

```bash
curl localhost:3000
Thanks for looking at Code-and-Response!
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you were using something like `mocha` for instnance

```bash
npm install mocha --save-dev
vi test/test.js
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you chose `eslint` for example

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
npx eslint --init
npx eslint sample-file.js
```

## Live demo

You can find a running system to test at [callforcode.mybluemix.net](http://callforcode.mybluemix.net/)

## Built with

* [IBM Cloudant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=cloudant#search_results) - The NoSQL database used
* .NET
